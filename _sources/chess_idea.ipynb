    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This aim of this project is to explore an interesting phenomenon within the world of chess, yet it will not focus on any human chess players. Instead this project will focus on chess matches between two opposing chess engines, of different and randomly selected ELO ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first you may believe that the chess engine with a higher ELO rating would always win, simply because chess is known to be a game of perfect information, and therefore the more skilled engine should win against a lesser skilled engine every time. However, by simulating thousands of games under these circumstances, it is noticeable that this is not the case, and that even when there is a large discrepancy amongst the two ELOs, an upset is still possible. This project will aim to analyze the occurrence of upsets between chess engines, and determine whether there may be telling signs of when an upset is possible, and perhaps even train a model to become the upset master.\n",

    "But first, we must gather the data!"

    "**Data Creation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will utilize a famous chess engine called \"Stockfish\", and in the process we will create two different engines; one to play the white pieces, and one for the black pieces. At the beginning of each simulation we will randomly select an ELO rating between 200 and 2500 for each engine. For reference, the highest ranked human chess player in the world, Magnus Carlsen, currently has an ELO floating around 2800.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in order to run this script you will need to have access to the Stockfish executable (Downloadable from their website @ https://stockfishchess.org/download). After downloading, you will need to specify the executable path as seen in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that you should be able to run this script and generate your own chess data to analyze. However, this script takes several hours to run, and therefore the script will first check to see whether this data has already been created, and if found, will use that instead. Because the resulting CSV file is large (around 500mb), I have decided to split up the CSV into 5 smaller files, that way they can be uploaded to the Github repository and anyone interested in analyzing this data won't have to wait for hours to have fun analyzing!"

    "After that first cell has completed running, you should now be in possession of a Pandas DataFrame containing the results of 50,000 simulated chess matches. The DataFrame has 8 columns in total, with the first being the FEN (Forsyth–Edwards Notation, a standard way for describing board position) at the end of the game. The next column contains a separate DataFrame with all the individual moves made during that particular game. Now after running 50,000 simulations, we will have over 6,000,000 moves to analyze. The DataFrame also contains a count of move pairs made during the match, the match result, winner, ELO rankings, and a boolean column describing whether the match ended in an upset, where the lower ranked engine beat the higher ranked.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that we have a Pandas DataFrame containing the results of our simulation, we can begin to explore the data and determine whether there are any common traits amongst games that ended in an upset."

    "Based on the plots above, we can confirm that ELO rankings are *mostly* drawn from a uniform distribution as we specified earlier. But what else is interesting is that it seems the number of upsets decreases exponentially with a larger difference in the ELO rankings of opponents. This makes sense as it is surely more likely that an upset would occur between closely ranked opponents, but nonetheless it can still happen even with differences larger than 2000! The bottom row of charts also helps see if there is a possible correlation between the length of a game and the chances of it becoming an upset. However, as we can see it seems that the distribution of game lengths amongst upsets appears roughly similar to the overall distribution of game lengths, meaning that there does not appear to be a strong correlation between how long a game lasts and whether it will end in an upset.\n",
