    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This aim of this project is to explore an interesting phenomenon within the world of chess, yet it will not focus on any human chess players. Instead this project will focus on chess matches between two opposing chess engines, of different and randomly selected ELO ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first you may believe that the chess engine with a higher ELO rating would always win, simply because chess is known to be a game of perfect information, and therefore the more skilled engine should win against a lesser skilled engine every time. However, by simulating thousands of games under these circumstances, it is noticeable that this is not the case, and that even when there is a large discrepancy amongst the two ELOs, an upset is still possible. This project will aim to analyze the occurrence of upsets between chess engines, determine whether there may be telling signs of when an upset is possible, and attempt to train a model that can determine who is more likely to win given a board position.\n",

    "**Important Note Regarding Project Dependencies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "During the creation of this notebook I came to the conclusion that I needed a way to significantly increase the speed of my data processing, especially since some points of this tutorial deal with over a million rows at once. Thus I have decided to utilize the RAPIDS toolkit, which allows me to utilize many of the popular Python data science libraries, but with GPU support. In my personal machine I have a NVIDIA 3080 Ti GPU, and wanted to see if I could harness its power to help speed up runtime. However, if you are without a GPU, this project can use a CPU instead, albeit it will run slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAPIDS: https://rapids.ai/\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you see \"cudf\" in this project, that is referring to the RAPIDS version of Pandas. It is functionally almost entirely the same but instead uses GPU compute power instead of CPU. This also helps later in the project when I train an XGBoost classifier, again with GPU enabled support.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that this notebook requires a Linux environment to run. This is because the RAPIDS toolkit is currently only supported on Linux. I personally have a Windows machine, and utilized WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to develop and run this notebook. I would recommend checking it out if interested @ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install."

    "**Data Creation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will utilize a famous chess engine called \"Stockfish\", and in the process we will create two different engines; one to play the white pieces, and one for the black pieces. At the beginning of each simulation we will randomly select an ELO rating between 200 and 2500 for each engine. For reference, the highest ranked human chess player in the world, Magnus Carlsen, currently has an ELO floating around 2800.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in order to run this script you will need to have access to the Stockfish executable (Downloadable from their website @ https://stockfishchess.org/download). After downloading, you will need to specify the executable path as seen in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that you should be able to run this script and generate your own chess data to analyze. However, this script takes several hours to run, and therefore the script will first check to see whether this data has already been created, and if found, will use that instead. Because the resulting CSV file is large (around 500mb), I have decided to split up the CSV into 5 smaller files, that way they can be uploaded to the Github repository and anyone interested in analyzing this data won't have to wait for hours to have fun analyzing!"

The DataFrame has 8 columns in total, with the first being the FEN (Forsyth–Edwards Notation, a standard way for describing board position) at the end of the game. The next column contains a CSV string representing all the individual moves made during that particular game. Now after running 50,000 simulations, we will have roughly over 6,000,000 moves to analyze. The DataFrame also contains a count of move pairs made during the match, the match result, winner, ELO rankings, and a boolean column describing whether the match ended in an upset, where the lower ranked engine beat the higher ranked.\n",

    "Based on the plots above, we can confirm that ELO rankings are *mostly* drawn from a uniform distribution as we specified earlier. But what else is interesting is that it seems the number of upsets decreases exponentially with a larger difference in the ELO rankings of opponents. This makes sense as it is surely more likely that an upset would occur between closely ranked opponents, but nonetheless it can still happen even with differences larger than 2000! The bottom row of charts also helps see if there is a possible correlation between the length of a game and the chances of it becoming an upset. However, as we can see it seems that the distribution of game lengths amongst upsets appears roughly similar to the overall distribution of game lengths, meaning that there does not appear to be a strong correlation between how long a game lasts and whether it will end in an upset.\n",

    "And there you have it! Given the current FEN it predicts that white still has a 50.28% chance of winning despite a pretty gruesome board position. Obviously it is no secret as to why that probability is so high though. Because we have trained our model solely off of games that ended in upsets, it will of course have a bias towards the underdog in a given position. This is definitely an interesting observation and it would be interesting to continue tinkering with various parameters and inputs to see if we can get more accurate results in the future."
